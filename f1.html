             with syntax errors.</font> The parsing process was also required to "fix" these errors as best it could. The result
             was often not correct (i.e., it did not represent what a careless coder had originally intended) but was at
             least valid according to the <tt>HTML</tt> standard. Only in the <strike><b>rarest cases</b></strike> would 
             the parser abandon parsing altogether.
